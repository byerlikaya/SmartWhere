## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or Rider
- Git

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SmartWhere.git
   cd SmartWhere
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run Tests**

   ```

## Coding Standards

### C# Coding Standards

- Follow [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Keep methods small and focused
- Use SOLID principles
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

### Code Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use PascalCase for public members
- Use camelCase for private members and parameters
- Use meaningful names that describe the purpose
- Add comments for complex logic

### Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Filters an IQueryable collection based on WhereClause attributes.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The type of entities to filter.</typeparam>
/// <param name="query">The IQueryable collection to filter.</param>
/// <param name="filterObject">The object containing filter values.</param>
/// <returns>A filtered IQueryable collection.</returns>
public static IQueryable<T> Where<T>(this IQueryable<T> query, object filterObject)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include unit tests
- All bug fixes must include regression tests
- Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- Tests should be fast, reliable, and isolated

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test project
dotnet test tests/SmartWhere.Tests/
```

### Test Naming Convention

```csharp
[Test]
public void MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior()
{
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
}
```
